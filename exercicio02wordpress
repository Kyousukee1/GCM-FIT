From the WordPress 4.7.2 release post: WordPress versions 4.7.1 and earlier are affected by three security issues:

The user interface for assigning taxonomy terms in Press This is shown to users who do not have permissions to use it. Reported by David Herrera of Alley Interactive.
WP_Query is vulnerable to a SQL injection (SQLi) when passing unsafe data. WordPress core is not directly vulnerable to this issue, but weâ€™ve added hardening to prevent plugins and themes from accidentally causing a vulnerability. Reported by Mo Jangda (batmoo).
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the posts list table. Reported by Ian Dunn of the WordPress Security Team.
From the additional 4.7.2 security disclosure, WordPress versions 4.7.0 and 4.7.1 are affected by the following security issue:

There was an Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in a REST API Endpoint. Previous versions of WordPress, even with the REST API Plugin, were never vulnerable to this. Reported by Marc-Alexandre Montpas of Sucuri.
